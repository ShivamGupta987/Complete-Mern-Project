Food Service Platform
Project Overview
Welcome to our comprehensive full-stack web application tailored for food service enthusiasts and entrepreneurs. This Food Service Platform revolutionizes the way users interact with food services online, offering robust features such as user authentication, an administrative dashboard, user profile management, menu browsing, and an intuitive add-to-cart functionality. Our backend is engineered with Node.js and Express, leveraging MongoDB for data storage, complemented by Mongoose for data modeling. The frontend is beautifully crafted using React, styled with Tailwind CSS, enhanced with DaisyUI components, and employs SweetAlert for engaging user notifications. Authentication is seamlessly handled by Firebase, ensuring a secure and efficient user experience, while Axios facilitates robust HTTP requests.
